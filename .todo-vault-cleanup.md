# Obsidian Vault Cleanup TODO

> Started: 2024-12-11
> Status: In Progress

---

## 🔴 Critical (Do First)

- [x] Create `attachments/` folder
- [x] Move all pasted images to `attachments/`
- [x] Configure Obsidian to use `attachments/` for new images
- [x] Delete duplicate `prs/` folder
- [x] Move stray files from root (`Untitled.canvas`, etc.)

## 🟡 Structure Improvements

- [ ] Restructure `checkpoint/` folder:
  - [ ] Create `checkpoint/team/` for team management
  - [ ] Create `checkpoint/projects/` for active work
  - [ ] Create `checkpoint/code/` for technical stuff
  - [ ] Create `checkpoint/incidents/` for bugs & outages
  - [ ] Create `checkpoint/management/` for your TL growth
  - [ ] Create `checkpoint/reference/` for architecture, docs
  - [ ] Move files to new structure

- [ ] Rename `public_obsidian/` to `learning/` or `resources/`

- [ ] Merge `AWS/` folder into appropriate location

## 🟢 Enhancements (Later)

- [ ] Add daily notes workflow
  - [ ] Create `journal/` folder structure
  - [ ] Create daily note template
  - [ ] Configure Periodic Notes plugin

- [ ] Standardize naming conventions
  - [ ] Use ISO dates: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
  - [ ] Rename meeting files to ISO format
  - [ ] Replace "Home.md" with `_index.md` pattern

- [ ] Improve Home/Index notes
  - [ ] Add Dataview queries to `Checkpoint Home.md`
  - [ ] Create better dashboards

- [ ] Add frontmatter to existing notes
  - [ ] Add `date`, `type`, `tags` to key notes

## 📝 Notes

### Attachment Fix
Images moved from root to `attachments/`. 
Obsidian setting updated: Files & links → Default location → `attachments`
